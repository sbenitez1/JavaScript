My first steps in JavaScript

#How to run the code
As a first approach, we can create a file containing the code (see, the simplest example, "HelloWorld.js") and launch it by:
  1. First, having installed "node.js(.exe)".
  2. Then, open the command prompt and change into the working directory (where the js file to launch is hosted).
  3. Type (for example, if we use "HelloWorld.js"), "node HelloWorld.js". 
  4. The results will be shown on the screen.
